          Welcome to Bobcat Medical. These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of our website at bobcatmedical.com (the "Site") and any orders you place with us. By using the Site or placing an order, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, please do not use the Site or our services.
        </p>

        <h2 class="font-display text-2xl font-bold text-warm-900 pt-4">1. Use of the Site</h2>
        <p>
          You may use the Site only for lawful purposes and in accordance with these Terms. You agree not to use the Site to: (a) violate any law or regulation; (b) infringe the rights of others; (c) transmit harmful or malicious code; (d) attempt to gain unauthorized access to our systems or other users' accounts; or (e) interfere with or disrupt the Site or our services. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate access for conduct we believe violates these Terms or is harmful to others or us.
        </p>

        <h2 class="font-display text-2xl font-bold text-warm-900 pt-4">2. Products and Orders</h2>
        <p>
          We strive to display our products and pricing accurately. We reserve the right to correct errors, limit quantities, and refuse or cancel orders (including after acceptance) in the event of pricing or availability errors, suspected fraud, or for other reasons consistent with good faith business practice. If your order is cancelled after payment, we will refund the amount paid.
        </p>
        <p>
          All orders are subject to acceptance and availability. We will send an order confirmation by email; that email is our acceptance of your order. We do not guarantee that all products shown are in stock at all times.
        </p>

        <h2 class="font-display text-2xl font-bold text-warm-900 pt-4">3. Pricing and Payment</h2>
        <p>
          Prices are in U.S. dollars and do not include applicable taxes or shipping unless stated. You are responsible for any sales tax, VAT, or other taxes that apply to your order. We accept the payment methods displayed at checkout. By providing payment information, you represent that you are authorized to use it. We use third-party payment processors; their terms may also apply.
        </p>

        <h2 class="font-display text-2xl font-bold text-warm-900 pt-4">4. Shipping and Delivery</h2>
        <p>
          Shipping times and costs are estimates and may vary. We are not responsible for delays caused by carriers or events outside our control. Risk of loss and title for items pass to you upon delivery to the carrier. If your order is lost or damaged in transit, please contact us and we will work with you and the carrier to resolve the issue in accordance with our policies.
        </p>

Returns must comply with the stated conditions (e.g., time frame, condition of product). Refunds will be processed in accordance with our policy and may take several business days to appear on your statement.
