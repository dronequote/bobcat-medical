## Working the night shift?

Night shift nursing is a unique challenge that requires special preparation. After countless conversations with nurses who work the overnight hours, we've compiled the ultimate list of must-haves for surviving—and thriving—during those long nights.

### 1. A Great Stethoscope Holder

Your stethoscope is your lifeline, but constantly draping it around your neck or stuffing it in your pocket gets old fast. A **magnetic stethoscope holder** keeps it secure, accessible, and out of your way. One quick grab and you're ready to assess your patient. No more fishing around or worrying about it falling on the floor.

*Pro tip: Our [Magnetic Stethoscope Holder](/shop/product/magnetic-stethoscope-holder) features a strong rare-earth magnet that won't let go until you need it to.*

### 2. Comfortable Compression Socks

Twelve hours on your feet is no joke. Compression socks improve circulation, reduce swelling, and can genuinely make the difference between dragging yourself to your car and walking out feeling human. Invest in a few good pairs—your legs will thank you.

### 3. A Reliable Fanny Pack

Pens, scissors, alcohol swabs, your phone, a granola bar—you need quick access to a lot of stuff. A well-designed [nurse fanny pack](/shop/product/nurse-fanny-pack) keeps everything organized and within reach, so you're not constantly running back to the nurses' station.

### 4. Quality Snacks

The vending machine at 3 AM is not your friend. Pack protein-rich snacks like nuts, cheese, and Greek yogurt. Your energy levels (and your waistline) will appreciate it. Bonus points if you meal prep for the whole week.

### 5. A Good Water Bottle

Dehydration sneaks up on you during busy shifts. Keep a large, insulated water bottle at your station and set reminders to drink if you have to. Your body can't function at its best without proper hydration.

### 6. Blue Light Blocking Glasses

Hospital fluorescent lights are harsh, and if you're trying to flip your sleep schedule, excessive blue light exposure makes it harder. Blue light blocking glasses can help reduce eye strain and might help you fall asleep easier after your shift.

### 7. Caffeine (In Moderation)

Strategic caffeine use is key. A cup of coffee at the start of your shift? Great. Chugging energy drinks at 4 AM? You'll regret it when you're staring at the ceiling at noon trying to sleep. Find your balance.

### 8. A Cozy Jacket or Sweater

Hospitals love their air conditioning. A lightweight jacket you can throw on when you're charting or during slower moments can make a big difference in your comfort level.

### 9. Quality Hand Cream

Washing your hands dozens of times per shift takes a toll on your skin. Keep a small tube of heavy-duty hand cream in your pocket. Apply it during brief moments of downtime—cracked, painful hands are no fun.

### 10. A Positive Attitude

This might sound cliché, but mindset matters. Night shift can be isolating and exhausting, but it also has its perks—often a tighter-knit team, fewer visitors to navigate, and the satisfaction of being there when patients need you most. Find the positives and lean into them.

## The Stethoscope Struggle Is Real

Every nurse knows the feeling: you need to quickly assess a patient, but your stethoscope is... where exactly? Around your neck (uncomfortable)? In your pocket (bulky)? On the counter somewhere (unsanitary)?

Let's break down the most popular ways to carry your stethoscope and find the best option for your workflow.

### Option 1: Around Your Neck

**The Classic Approach**

This is how most of us started, and for good reason—it's simple and keeps your stethoscope within reach.

**Pros:**
- Always accessible
- No additional accessories needed
- You look like a healthcare professional

**Cons:**
- Neck strain after long shifts
- Gets in the way when leaning over patients
- Can feel heavy with quality stethoscopes
- Potential infection control concern

**Verdict:** Works in a pinch, but there are better options for long shifts.

### Option 2: In Your Pocket

**The Pocket Stuffer**

Many nurses try to shove their stethoscope into scrub pockets. Results vary.

**Pros:**
- Out of the way
- Free neck and shoulders

**Cons:**
- Bulky and uncomfortable
- Difficult to retrieve quickly
- Stretches out your scrub pockets
- Tubing can get kinked

**Verdict:** Not ideal for quick-access situations.

### Option 3: Clip-On Holders

**The Traditional Holder**

Basic plastic or fabric clips that attach to your waistband.

**Pros:**
- Inexpensive
- Lightweight
- Keeps stethoscope accessible

**Cons:**
- Can fall off
- Limited weight capacity
- Some feel flimsy

**Verdict:** A budget-friendly option, but durability can be an issue.

### Option 4: Velcro Stethoscope Holders

**The Secure Choice**

Hook-and-loop (Velcro) holders wrap around your stethoscope tubing and attach to your scrubs.

**Pros:**
- Secure attachment
- Easy to use
- Works with most scrub fabrics
- Adjustable positioning

**Cons:**
- Velcro can wear out over time
- May not work well with all fabric types

**Verdict:** A reliable choice for most nurses. Check out our [Velcro Stethoscope Holder](/shop/product/velcro-stethoscope-holder) for a durable option.

### Option 5: Magnetic Stethoscope Holders

**The Game Changer**

Magnetic holders use powerful magnets to secure your stethoscope to your scrubs with a simple click.

**Pros:**
- One-hand operation
- Strong hold that won't accidentally release
- Quick grab-and-go access
- Works through fabric
- No wear and tear on attachment mechanism

**Cons:**
- Slightly higher price point
- Need to avoid placing near credit cards or electronic devices

**Verdict:** Our top recommendation for busy healthcare professionals. The [Magnetic Stethoscope Holder](/shop/product/magnetic-stethoscope-holder) is a favorite among ER and ICU nurses who need fast access.

---

## Our Recommendation

After talking with hundreds of nurses, we've found that **magnetic holders** consistently get the highest satisfaction ratings. The combination of security and quick access makes them ideal for fast-paced healthcare environments.

That said, **velcro holders** are a close second and work great for those who prefer a more traditional feel or work in environments where magnets might be a concern.

## The Magnetic Advantage

When it comes to keeping your stethoscope accessible during busy shifts, not all holders are created equal. After extensive testing and feedback from healthcare professionals across the country, we've become big believers in magnetic stethoscope holders. Here's why.

### 1. Lightning-Fast Access

In healthcare, seconds matter. When a patient's condition changes or you need to quickly assess someone, fumbling with clips or straps costs precious time.

With a magnetic holder, it's literally **grab and go**. The stethoscope releases instantly when you pull it, and re-attaching takes about half a second—just bring it near the magnet and it snaps into place.

*"I work in the ER and the magnetic holder has genuinely changed how I work. I can go from charting to listening to a patient's lungs in one fluid motion."* — Dr. Emily Torres, Emergency Medicine

### 2. Secure Hold

The number one concern we hear about magnetic holders: "Will it actually stay on?"

The answer is a resounding yes. Quality magnetic holders use **rare-earth neodymium magnets** that provide an incredibly strong hold. Your stethoscope isn't going anywhere until you intentionally remove it.

We've tested ours through:
- Running (yes, actual running down hallways)
- Bending and squatting
- Lifting patients
- Full 12-hour shifts

The stethoscope stays put.

### 3. No Wear and Tear

Traditional holders rely on mechanical mechanisms—clips that can break, velcro that wears out, elastic that loses its stretch. These components have a limited lifespan.

Magnets, on the other hand, maintain their strength for decades. There are no moving parts to fail. The magnetic holder you buy today will work just as well in five years.

### 4. Works Through Fabric

One of the clever aspects of magnetic holders is that you don't need to directly attach anything to your stethoscope. The system uses two magnetic components—one clips to your scrubs, one to your stethoscope—and they attract through the fabric.

This means:
- No holes in your scrubs
- Easy to transfer between different outfits
- Works with any fabric thickness

### 5. One-Handed Operation

Try this: while holding a chart or medication, attach a stethoscope to a traditional clip. Frustrating, right?

Magnetic holders are inherently one-handed. Just bring the stethoscope near the magnet and let physics do the work. This is especially valuable when your other hand is occupied (which, let's be honest, is most of the time).

### 6. Professional Appearance

A dangling stethoscope or one crammed in a pocket doesn't exactly scream "I have my life together." Magnetic holders keep your stethoscope neatly positioned at your side, looking professional and intentional.

### 7. Infection Control

Because there's no need to touch clasps, clips, or straps, magnetic holders minimize contact points. You grab your stethoscope by the part you're going to use anyway—the chest piece or earpieces—rather than handling a potentially contaminated holder mechanism.

---

## Common Concerns Addressed

### "What about my credit cards?"

Valid concern! Magnets can damage magnetic strips on cards. The solution is simple: don't store cards directly against the magnet. Keep them in a badge holder, wallet, or separate pocket. In practice, this isn't an issue for most users.

### "Will it affect my phone?"

Modern smartphones are not affected by the strength of magnets used in stethoscope holders. You can safely keep your phone in an adjacent pocket.

### "What if I have a pacemaker?"

While the magnets in stethoscope holders are small, if you have an implanted medical device, consult with your physician before using magnetic accessories near your chest. Most people position the holder at their waist, which provides adequate distance.

## You Can't Pour From an Empty Cup

Healthcare workers spend their days caring for others, but who takes care of you? Burnout, compassion fatigue, and physical exhaustion are real challenges in our profession. Here are practical self-care strategies that actually work for busy healthcare professionals.

### Physical Self-Care

#### Prioritize Sleep

Yes, you've heard it before. But sleep isn't optional—it's foundational. If you work rotating shifts:
- Keep your bedroom dark and cool
- Invest in blackout curtains
- Use white noise to block daytime sounds
- Stick to a consistent sleep schedule, even on days off

#### Move Your Body (Outside of Work)

Running between patient rooms doesn't count as exercise. Your body needs intentional movement that isn't tied to stress:
- Try yoga or stretching for tension relief
- Take walks in nature on your days off
- Strength training helps combat the physical demands of patient care

#### Fuel Yourself Properly

It's easy to survive on coffee and vending machine snacks, but your body needs real nutrition:
- Meal prep on days off
- Keep healthy snacks in your locker
- Stay hydrated—aim for half your body weight in ounces of water daily

### Mental Self-Care

#### Set Boundaries

It's okay to say no. You don't have to pick up every extra shift. You don't have to be everyone's emotional support. Setting boundaries isn't selfish—it's survival.

#### Process Difficult Experiences

Healthcare exposes you to trauma. That doesn't mean you have to carry it alone:
- Talk to colleagues who understand
- Consider a therapist who specializes in healthcare workers
- Journaling can help process complex emotions

#### Disconnect From Work

When you're off, be **off**. Don't check work emails. Don't doomscroll medical news. Give your brain a genuine break from healthcare content.

### Emotional Self-Care

#### Cultivate Relationships Outside Healthcare

Having friends and family who don't work in healthcare provides valuable perspective. Spend time with people who remind you there's a world outside the hospital.

#### Find Joy in Small Things

What made you happy before you became a healthcare worker? Reconnect with those hobbies. Read fiction. Watch silly shows. Play video games. Do things purely for enjoyment.

#### Practice Gratitude

It sounds cliché, but it works. Even on hard days, there are moments worth acknowledging. Some people keep a gratitude journal. Others simply take a moment at the end of each shift to note one positive thing.

### Professional Self-Care

#### Invest in Quality Gear

Using well-designed equipment makes your job easier. Uncomfortable scrubs, a heavy stethoscope around your neck, disorganized pockets—these small irritations add up. Invest in gear that supports you. (Shameless plug: That's exactly why we created [Bobcat Medical](/shop).)

#### Advocate for Yourself

Speak up about unsafe staffing ratios. Push back on unreasonable expectations. Your voice matters. Change happens when healthcare workers advocate collectively.

#### Keep Learning

Professional development isn't just about advancing your career. Learning new skills and staying current in your field can reignite your passion for healthcare.

---

## Start Small

You don't have to overhaul your entire life overnight. Pick one thing from this list and focus on it this week. Small, consistent changes create sustainable habits.

Remember: Taking care of yourself isn't selfish. It's necessary. Your patients need you at your best, and you deserve to feel good too.

## The Chaos of Nursing Supplies

We've all been there: you need scissors, but they're... somewhere. Alcohol swabs? Maybe in your left pocket. Or was it the right? Your phone just buzzed but it's buried under a pile of flushes and gauze.

Let's bring some order to the chaos.

### Why Organization Matters

Beyond the obvious frustration of not finding what you need, disorganization has real consequences:
- **Time wasted** searching for supplies adds up over a shift
- **Patient care suffers** when you're distracted by logistics
- **Stress increases** when you can't rely on your systems

Good organization isn't about being Type A—it's about creating systems that support you so you can focus on what matters: your patients.

### The Essential Nursing Carry

Every nurse's exact loadout varies, but here's what most of us carry:

**The Non-Negotiables:**
- Stethoscope
- Penlight
- Hemostats or bandage scissors
- Pens (at least 3—they disappear)
- Permanent marker
- Phone

**The Nice-to-Haves:**
- Small notebook or brain sheet
- Alcohol swabs
- Flushes
- Tape
- Personal hand sanitizer
- Lip balm
- Snacks

### Organizing Strategies That Work

#### 1. Dedicated Pockets for Dedicated Items

Assign each item a specific location and stick to it religiously. After a week, reaching for your penlight becomes muscle memory.

**Example setup:**
- Right scrub pocket: Phone, penlight
- Left scrub pocket: Pens, marker
- Fanny pack front: Scissors, hemostats, alcohol swabs
- Fanny pack back: Personal items (lip balm, snacks, hand cream)

#### 2. Invest in a Quality Fanny Pack

Scrub pockets are limited. A good [nurse fanny pack](/shop/product/nurse-fanny-pack) multiplies your carrying capacity without the bulk of a traditional bag.

Look for:
- Multiple compartments for organization
- Easy-clean material
- Comfortable fit that doesn't ride up
- Secure closures

#### 3. Keep Your Stethoscope Accessible (Not Around Your Neck)

A [stethoscope holder](/shop?category=stethoscope-holders) frees your neck from strain while keeping your most-used tool within instant reach. Whether you prefer magnetic or velcro, find a system that works for you.

#### 4. Pre-Shift Pocket Check

Before every shift, do a quick inventory:
- All items in their designated spots?
- Pens working?
- Phone charged?
- Essential supplies stocked?

This 60-second routine prevents the mid-shift scramble.

#### 5. End-of-Shift Reset

Empty your pockets completely after each shift. Clean out trash, restock supplies, and return everything to its home. Starting fresh each shift prevents accumulation of random items.

### Common Organization Mistakes

**Overpacking:** You don't need to carry everything. If you're weighed down like a pack mule, you're probably carrying items that could stay in your locker or at the nurses' station.

**No system:** Randomly shoving things in pockets means you're always searching. Take time to create a system.

**Ignoring comfort:** If your organizational tools are uncomfortable (a heavy fanny pack, a scratchy stethoscope holder), you won't use them consistently.

**Not adapting:** What works in one unit might not work in another. Float to a different department? You might need to adjust your loadout.

## Your First Year: A Survival Guide

Congratulations! You passed NCLEX, landed your first nursing job, and now the real learning begins. The first year of nursing is notoriously challenging—but also incredibly rewarding. Here's what experienced nurses wish they'd known from day one.

### The Reality Check

Let's be honest: nursing school prepared you for the exams, not entirely for the job. You'll feel overwhelmed. You'll question whether you made the right choice. You'll cry in the supply closet (we've all been there).

This is normal. It doesn't mean you're a bad nurse—it means you're human.

### Practical Tips That Actually Help

#### 1. Find Your People

Identify the experienced nurses who want to help new grads succeed. Every unit has them—the ones who answer questions without judgment and share their shortcuts. These are your lifelines.

Equally important: find other new nurses going through the same experience. Having someone to debrief with after a tough shift is invaluable.

#### 2. Write Everything Down

Get a small notebook that fits in your pocket. Write down:
- Important phone extensions
- Normal lab values
- Medication doses you look up repeatedly
- Tips from experienced nurses
- Questions to research later

Your brain can only hold so much. Don't trust it to remember everything.

#### 3. Invest in Quality Gear Early

Uncomfortable shoes will destroy your feet. A stethoscope around your neck will hurt by hour six. Disorganized pockets mean wasted time.

Spend money on:
- **Quality shoes** with proper support
- **A stethoscope holder** that keeps your scope accessible without the neck pain
- **A good watch** with a second hand for pulses and respirations
- **Compression socks** for those 12-hour shifts

The small investments make a big difference in your comfort and efficiency.

#### 4. Ask Questions (Seriously)

You will not know everything. That's okay—it's expected. What's NOT okay is pretending you know something when you don't.

Good questions to ask:
- "Can you show me how you do this?"
- "What should I watch for with this patient?"
- "Is there a better/faster way to do this?"
- "I've never done this before—can you walk me through it?"

No one expects you to be an expert. They expect you to be safe and willing to learn.

#### 5. Master Time Management

Time management is the hardest skill to develop, and it takes months to get comfortable. Some tips:

- **Cluster your care** when possible
- **Anticipate needs** before they become urgent
- **Don't chart later**—chart as you go when possible
- **Set alarms** for time-sensitive medications
- **Build in buffer time** for the unexpected

#### 6. Take Care of Yourself

You cannot pour from an empty cup. First-year nurses often neglect their own health trying to prove themselves. Don't.

- **Sleep** is not optional
- **Eat actual meals**, not just vending machine snacks
- **Stay hydrated**—keep water at your station
- **Use your days off** to actually rest

### The Emotional Side

#### It Gets Easier

The overwhelming feeling does fade. Around month 3-6, things start to click. By year one, you'll look back and be amazed at how much you've grown.

#### You Will Make Mistakes

Every nurse makes mistakes. The difference between a good nurse and a dangerous one isn't the absence of errors—it's how they handle them.

- **Report errors** immediately and honestly
- **Learn from mistakes** without spiraling into shame
- **Implement systems** to prevent repeating errors

#### Patient Deaths Are Hard

You will lose patients. Some deaths will be expected; others will blindside you. There's no "right" way to grieve.

- It's okay to cry
- Talk to colleagues who understand
- Seek professional support if needed
- Remember: the fact that it affects you means you care

### Resources for New Nurses

- **Your facility's new grad program** (use every resource they offer)
- **Preceptors and mentors** (stay in touch even after orientation ends)
- **Online nursing communities** (for questions you're embarrassed to ask in person)
- **Continuing education** (never stop learning)

---

## You've Got This

The first year is hard. There's no sugarcoating it. But millions of nurses have survived it, and you will too. The key is to stay humble, keep learning, ask for help, and take care of yourself.

One year from now, you'll be the one helping a new grad find their feet. And you'll remember exactly how it felt.

## The Complete Pocket Checklist

There's an art to packing your scrub pockets. Too little, and you're constantly running back to the nurses' station. Too much, and you're a walking supply closet. Let's find the sweet spot.

### The Non-Negotiables

These items should be on your person at all times:

#### Writing Tools
- **3-4 pens** (they disappear—accept this)
- **1 permanent marker** (for labeling tubes, bags, dressings)
- **1 highlighter** (optional, but useful for some workflows)

*Pro tip: Click pens are less likely to leak than cap pens, but cap pens are less likely to accidentally mark your scrubs.*

#### Assessment Tools
- **Penlight** (compact LED versions last forever)
- **Stethoscope** (with a proper [holder](/shop?category=stethoscope-holders) so it's not around your neck)
- **Bandage scissors** or trauma shears (on a retractable clip)

#### Time & Communication
- **Watch with second hand** (digital or analog, just needs seconds)
- **Phone** (if allowed—many facilities now encourage them for communication apps)
- **Badge with required ID**

### The "Nice to Have" List

These items are helpful but not critical for every shift:

#### Medical Supplies
- Alcohol swabs (a few in a baggie)
- Small roll of tape
- Hemostats
- Personal hand sanitizer (the good stuff, not the hospital-issue)
- Gloves (a pair in case you need them between supply rooms)

#### Personal Care
- Lip balm (hospital air is DRY)
- Hand cream (for when you get a moment)
- Breath mints or gum
- Hair ties (if applicable)

#### Snacks & Hydration
- Small protein bar or snacks
- Electrolyte packets
- Note: Keep a water bottle at your station, not in your pocket

### The Organizational System

Having the right stuff means nothing if you can't find it. Create a system:

#### Left Pocket
- Phone
- Personal items (lip balm, hand cream)
- Snacks

#### Right Pocket
- Pens and marker
- Penlight
- Small notebook or "brain" sheet

#### Fanny Pack / Accessory Pouch
This is where having a [good nurse fanny pack](/shop/product/nurse-fanny-pack) pays off:
- Scissors/shears
- Tape
- Alcohol swabs
- Hemostats
- Flushes
- Anything bulky that doesn't fit in scrub pockets

#### Stethoscope
On a [magnetic holder](/shop/product/magnetic-stethoscope-holder) or [velcro holder](/shop/product/velcro-stethoscope-holder) at your waist or chest—NOT around your neck for 12 hours.

### What NOT to Carry

Some things seem useful but aren't worth the pocket real estate:

- **Full medication guides** (use your phone app)
- **Multiple colors of tape** (grab from supply as needed)
- **Personal valuables** (keep in locker)
- **Bulk supplies** (restock as needed, don't hoard)
- **Anything you haven't used in the last 5 shifts**

### Unit-Specific Additions

Different specialties have different needs:

#### ICU/Critical Care
- Calculator (for drip rates)
- Extra pen lights
- Drug reference card

#### Pediatrics
- Fun stickers
- Small distraction toys
- Character bandages

#### Emergency Department
- Trauma shears (heavier duty)
- Extra hemostats
- Quick reference cards

#### Labor & Delivery
- Fetal heart tone reference
- Timing device for contractions

### The Pre-Shift Check

Before every shift, do a 60-second inventory:

1. ✅ All pockets restocked?
2. ✅ Pens working?
3. ✅ Phone charged?
4. ✅ Stethoscope holder attached?
5. ✅ Badge visible?

This quick check prevents the mid-shift scramble when you need something and can't find it.

## Gifts Nurses Will Actually Use

We love the thought behind "World's Best Nurse" mugs and angel-themed decor. Really, we do. But if you want to give a gift that a nurse will actually use and appreciate, read on.

These recommendations come from real nurses who've received (and given) it all.

### Tier 1: The Everyday Essentials

These are gifts that improve a nurse's daily work life:

#### Stethoscope Holder ($15-25)
A proper stethoscope holder is a game-changer. Most nurses don't buy one for themselves, making it a perfect gift.

- **[Magnetic holders](/shop/product/magnetic-stethoscope-holder)** are our top pick—strong, quick, and durable
- **[Velcro holders](/shop/product/velcro-stethoscope-holder)** are great for those who prefer a traditional feel

*Why they'll love it: No more neck pain from 12 hours of stethoscope-around-the-neck. Instant access when they need it.*

#### Quality Compression Socks ($20-40)
Not the boring beige medical ones—actual cute, colorful compression socks designed for long shifts. Brands like Comrad and Sockwell make great options.

*Why they'll love it: Their legs will thank you after every shift.*

#### Nurse Fanny Pack ($20-30)
A well-designed [fanny pack](/shop/product/nurse-fanny-pack) holds all those essentials that don't fit in scrub pockets. Look for multiple compartments and easy-clean material.

*Why they'll love it: Organization without the bulk.*

### Tier 2: Self-Care & Recovery

Nurses give care all day—help them recover:

#### Massage Gift Card ($50-100+)
A professional massage after a string of rough shifts is pure bliss. Book it for them if possible, since nurses often won't book it themselves.

#### High-Quality Lotion or Hand Cream ($15-30)
Constant hand washing and sanitizer destroys skin. Look for intensive repair creams like O'Keeffe's Working Hands, Eucerin, or Aquaphor.

*Pro tip: Get a small tube for their pocket AND a larger tub for home.*

#### Cozy Robe or Blanket ($30-60)
After a long shift, nothing beats wrapping up in something soft. Barefoot Dreams makes amazing (if pricey) options. Target and Amazon have great budget alternatives.

### Tier 3: Food & Drinks

The way to a nurse's heart is through their stomach:

#### Quality Coffee or Tea ($15-40)
Nurses run on caffeine. A nice coffee subscription, fancy loose-leaf tea set, or bag of premium beans is always appreciated.

#### Meal Delivery Gift Card ($50-100+)
DoorDash, Uber Eats, or Grubhub gift cards for those nights when cooking is absolutely not happening.

#### Snack Box Subscription ($20-50/month)
Services like SnackCrate or Bokksu deliver interesting snacks monthly. Perfect for night shift survival.

### Tier 4: Experiences

Sometimes the best gift is time away from healthcare:

#### Spa Day
Massage, facial, the works. Book it on their day off.

#### Nice Dinner Out
Somewhere they'd never take themselves. Make the reservation.

#### Weekend Getaway
If budget allows, a night or two at a nice hotel can be the ultimate reset.

### Gifts to Avoid

With love, please skip these:

❌ **"Nurses are angels" merchandise** - Sweet sentiment, but they have enough
❌ **Cheap stethoscopes** - They already have one they trust
❌ **Medical-themed jewelry** (unless you KNOW they want it)
❌ **Scrubs** - They're picky about fit and fabric
❌ **Anything that says "I'm a nurse, what's your superpower?"**
❌ **Live plants** - They work 12-hour shifts; the plant will die

### Budget-Friendly Ideas Under $20

Great gifts don't have to be expensive:

- Nice pens that actually work
- Good quality chapstick/lip balm set
- Fancy hand cream
- Coffee shop gift card
- Homemade baked goods (always a hit)
- A heartfelt card expressing what they mean to you

### The Best Gift of All

Honestly? Sometimes the best gift is just understanding.

- Don't be offended when they're too tired to hang out
- Bring them food during a rough stretch of shifts
- Listen when they need to vent
- Tell them you're proud of them
