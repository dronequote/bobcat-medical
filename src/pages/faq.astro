    questions: [
      {
        question: 'What is the difference between the magnetic and velcro stethoscope holders?',
        answer: 'The magnetic holder uses a magnetic closure; the velcro holder uses a Velcro loop closure. Both are strong and reliable. The choice comes down to personal preference, not performance.'
      },
      {
        question: 'What colors are available?',
        answer: 'Magnetic holder: Black, Navy Blue, Maroon, and Gray. Velcro holder: Black, Navy Blue, and Pink.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Will the magnetic holder damage my phone or credit cards?',
        answer: 'We have had no known issues. The holder is not placed near phones or wallets during normal use. If you have concerns, keep cards and devices in a separate pocket.'
      },
      {
        question: 'What stethoscopes are compatible with your holders?',
        answer: 'Our holders work with all major brands. Eko stethoscopes are not recommended—the Eko head shape and weight make it a poor fit. For other brands including Littmann, ADC, MDF, and similar, compatibility is excellent.'
      },
      {
        question: 'How do I clean my stethoscope holder?',
        answer: 'Any standard antibacterial wipe is sufficient. For deeper cleaning, the magnetic holder components can be separated and wiped; the velcro holder can be hand washed with mild soap and air dried.'
      }

  },
  {
    category: 'Shipping & Delivery',
    questions: [
      {
        question: 'How long does shipping take?',
        answer: 'Ground shipping within the continental US typically takes 3–5 business days. You will receive tracking once your order ships.'
      },

      },
      {

      },
      {
        question: 'Can I exchange for a different color or size?',

      },
      {
        question: 'Is my payment information secure?',
        answer: 'Yes. Your payment information is secure. We use industry-standard encryption and PCI-compliant processing; we do not store your full card details on our servers.'
      },
