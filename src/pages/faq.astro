    questions: [
      {
        question: 'What is the difference between the magnetic and velcro stethoscope holders?',
        answer: 'The magnetic stethoscope holder uses rare-earth neodymium magnets for instant grab-and-go access with one hand. The velcro holder uses hook-and-loop fasteners that wrap around your stethoscope tubing. Magnetic holders are faster to use but slightly higher priced, while velcro holders are more budget-friendly and work better in environments where magnets might be a concern (like near certain medical equipment).'
      },
      {
        question: 'Will the magnetic holder damage my phone or credit cards?',
        answer: 'Modern smartphones are not affected by the strength of magnets used in our stethoscope holders. However, we recommend keeping magnetic stripe credit cards in a separate pocket or badge holder to be safe. Chip-based cards are not affected by magnets.'
      },
      {
        question: 'What stethoscopes are compatible with your holders?',
        answer: 'Our stethoscope holders are designed to work with all major stethoscope brands including Littmann, ADC, MDF, and others. They accommodate standard tubing sizes and can hold both single and dual-tube stethoscopes securely.'
      },
      {
        question: 'How do I clean my stethoscope holder?',
        answer: 'Our holders can be wiped down with standard hospital-grade disinfectant wipes. For deeper cleaning, the magnetic holder components can be separated and cleaned individually. The velcro holder can be hand washed with mild soap and air dried.'
      },
      {
        question: 'What colors are available?',
        answer: 'Our magnetic stethoscope holders come in Black, Navy Blue, Maroon, and Beige. The velcro holders are available in Pink, Navy Blue, and Black. Our nurse fanny packs come in Pink, Black, Royal Blue, and Purple.'
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    category: 'Shipping & Delivery',
    questions: [
      {
        question: 'How long does shipping take?',
        answer: 'Standard shipping within the continental US typically takes 3-5 business days. Expedited shipping (2-3 business days) and overnight options are available at checkout. Orders placed before 2 PM EST on business days usually ship the same day.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Do you ship internationally?',
        answer: 'Yes! We ship to Canada, UK, Australia, and most European countries. International shipping typically takes 7-14 business days depending on the destination. Customs fees and import duties may apply and are the responsibility of the customer.'
      },
      {
        question: 'How can I track my order?',
        answer: 'Once your order ships, you\'ll receive an email with tracking information. You can also track your order by logging into your account on our website. If you checked out as a guest, use the tracking link in your shipping confirmation email.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Do you offer free shipping?',
        answer: 'Yes! We offer free standard shipping on all orders over $35 within the continental United States. Orders under $35 have a flat-rate shipping fee of $4.99.'
